		<img src="assets/images/image2.png" class="auth-image" alt="Ana">

		<p>I'm a personality that very easily comes into contact with other people.
            I tend to permanently help someone who needs me. I really like to sleep and eat ice cream.
             I always get pleasure when someone falls to me for unexpected gifts.</p>

		<p>Ive been interested in technology since I was young, and having family members in the tech field made it easier for me to choose what I wanted to do. I started working for my brothers web development company when I was 13 as a Social Media Manager, and left when I turned 17 to focus on school. Im excited to get back into it and learn everything about programming!</p>
