  Portfolio
# how I built 
For this project I have created 3 separate pages that make up my portfolio. It includes 3 links at the top of the page that will take you to each page. The first page is an "About Me" page that includes an image and description of who I am. The second page is the actual "Portfolio" page. This page includes links to all of my work. The last page is a "Contact" page. It connects you to me through filling out a form with your name and email.

You will need to have internet access and this link (https://ana199816.github.io/) to view the page.
Once there you can navigate the site using the three tabs at the top "About, Portfolio and Contact.
" You can interact with the portfolio page by clicking on the items as the scroll or manually scroll the items using the right and left arrows.

Built With: Visual Code Studio, style.css...
